# Supermarket Management System

A C++ console application for managing supermarket operations, including inventory, sales, promotions, customer loyalty, and order processing. This project demonstrates the use of data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, maps, and binary search trees to simulate real-world supermarket workflows.

- **Admin & Customer Workflows**: Separate menus and functionalities for admins and customers.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: C++
- **Data Structures**: Linked List, Stack, Queue, Map, Binary Search Tree, Priority Queue
- **Console I/O**: For user interaction
